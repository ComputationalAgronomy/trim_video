## PR Self Review:
Look for the following problems:
- [ ] Code is not following code style guidelines (add links to your guidelines here when copying this checklist).
- [ ] Bad naming: make sure you would understand your code if you read it a few months from now.
- [ ] KISS: Keep it simple, Sweetie (not stupid!).
- [ ] DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.
- [ ] YAGNI: You aren't gonna need it: check that you are not overcomplicating something for the sake of 'making it future-proof'.
- [ ] Code that is not readable: too many nested 'if's are a bad sign.
- [ ] Complicated constructions that need refactoring or comments: code should almost always be self-explanatory. -->
